"Polygon of Eyes" was the lead single from the Austin band's eponymous debut and it is quite the thing with its fast superfast riffage and the mid-tempo, stupidly catchy singalong chorus. It has all the swagger of a bone fide hard rock hit with enough energy to fill out a stadium or rock an arena to its core.
