"Corsicana Clip" is closer to 16 Horsepower, David Eugene Edwards's previous band, than anything Wovenhand have done since he disbanded the alt-country legends. The darkness in 16 Horsepower has always been a little bit on the playful side, playing on the mythos of the South meets the Dust Bowl, while Wovenhand takes that melancholy much further, culminating in songs that are sometimes desperately dark (in the best way possible) in their depiction of a more European variety of ye olde times.

Stylistically, it's also more akin to 16 Horsepower — more pared down, yet full of subtle touches. How the main riff transforms into the outro riff is nothing shy of masterful in its soft touch. The general upbeat air gives way to a melancholy coda.

I watched Wovenhand in a small gig in London while touring this album, in a small town hall in West London. Not an ideal place for a gig, the stage being just a few inches above the ground. I was at the front row, almost ecstatic that I would be seeing a legend on stage just a few feet away. But soon I wanted to get away from the stage as much as possible — they were too loud. So loud that my ears hurt for weeks on end for the first time in my life. I'm fairly sure it caused some permanent damage.

Who would have thought that of all the bands to hurt my ears, it was an alt-country band that did the trick? And that says all you need to know about Wovenhand.
