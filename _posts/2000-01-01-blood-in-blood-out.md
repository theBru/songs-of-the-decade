title: Blood in Blood out

"Tonight we're gonna fight like it's 1985" bellows Steve "Zetro" Souza. No shit.

The last couple of decades saw the likes of Exodus, Testament, and Death Angel (or the Other Three of Thrash, if you like) release some of their best work. And the Blood in Blood out album no exception. The title track is everything you want from a thrash metal party anthem â€” lightning-fast riffage, bludgeoning drums, and vocals straight out of the devil's larynx.

It's fast, impatient, obnoxiusly heavy, and just rocks.
