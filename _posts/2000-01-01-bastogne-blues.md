Crippled Black Phoenix's fourth release is full of unforgettable prog epics. There are two of them on this list. This, the longest of the lot with over 12 minutes of running time, is a sad ode to war and its psychological baggage on those who partake in it.

It starts off with an old man recalling how he killed a young enemy soldier, whose face still haunts him. This is the only time where spoken word fits a song perfectly. From that moment on, the band take things to even darker corners with an ever-evolving melancholy. It is emotionally draining song with melodies weaving in and out of as Justin Greaves gives his best vocal performance to date. And if that old Western coda doesn't get you, I don't know what to tell you.
