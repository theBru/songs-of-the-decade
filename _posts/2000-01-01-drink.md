Undoubtedly the world's greatest pirate metal band, Alestorm released what is perhaps the greatest drinking song of all time in 2014. It's as silly as it gets, but the quality of songwriting elevates it to be much, much more than a pure novelty item.

Now, all together: "We are here to drink your beer / and steal your rum at the point of a gun / your alcohol to us will fall / 'cause we are here to drink your beer!" 

Sl√°inte!
