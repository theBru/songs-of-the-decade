  blurb: |
    <p>This is a song of two very distinct parts, but held brilliantly well by a subtle shift in tones that comes in about halfway through. The first part is a song perfect for a dark, smoky bar with a fine tumbler of whiskey in one hand.</p>
    <p>Then the song suddenly shifts to a soaring, uplifing coda that at first feels quite out of place, but by the end it all makes sense. Much like The Hold Steady.</p>

    <p>An unsung hero of the punk rock world they may be, but Anti-Flag are just too good to be stuck in the lower tier. Case in point is this melodic belter. Subtle it may not be (when was punk ever subtle anout anything?), but it's very clever in its arrangement and of its time in its lyrics.</p>
    <p>The shift in tone from shoegazer punk, to pseudo-mosh freakout bridge, to an arena-rock-friendly chorus is masterfully done. It makes you rock and think, as the cliché goes.</p>

    <p>Sounding like it's straight out of <span class="bold-text">Consider the Birds</span> (2004) or <span class="bold-text">Mosaic</span> (2006) albums, this was a reminder what a potent songwriter David Eugene Edwards is — soaring, melodic, and the right shade of melancholic, the song evolves beautifully from a banjo-led intro with  indecisive interludes by the band, to a full-blown "arena-rock moment" of an outro as it lets the hook carry it all to beautiful coda.</p>

    <p>A sad ode to war and its psychological baggage on those who partake in it, this is the first of two CBP songs on this list.</p>
    <p>A melancholy epic ballad that starts with a war veteran recalling the moment when he killed an enemy soldier point blank. Then it gets darker and darker as it sucks you in to a melodic loop that is sad and uplifting at the same time. It's truly a majestic song.</p>

  blurb: |
    <p>"Polygon of Eyes" was the lead single from the Austin band's eponymous debut and it is quite the thing with its fast superfast riffage and the mid-tempo, stupidly catchy singalong chorus. It has all the swagger of a bone fide hard rock hit with enough energy to fill out a stadium or rock the foundations of any place you deem appropriate to listen to it in.</p>

    <p>One of two Shinedown tracks on this list, the kings of bro-rock's know how to pen a hook or three.</p>

  blurb: |
    <p>"Tonight we're gonna fight like it's 1985" bellows Steve "Zetro" Souza. No shit.</p>
    <p>Fast, impatient, obnoxiously heavy, "Blood in Blood out" is the epitome of thrash metal with its lightning-fast riffage, bludgenoning drums, and vocals straight from the devil's larynx.</p>
