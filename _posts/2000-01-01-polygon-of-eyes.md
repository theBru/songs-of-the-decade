The year is 2013 and the world is ready for a new band that will upend the hard rock scene and Scorpion Child steps up to the plate. Whilst their album offered plenty of in the swagger department, there was one song that really pointed at something really special. Maybe they were the saviours of rock'n'roll.

Well, rock'n'roll never needed saving, but Polygon of Eyes with its stuttering riff and the perfect-for-arena-singalongs chorus was really something.
