One of two Shinedown tracks on this list, the kings of bro-rock's most recent album didn't rock in as many places, but there were a handful of songs that were vintage Shinedown. And the best of them was the second single, "The Human Radio".

The chorus, sang with a proper choir, should be pure cheesefest. However, the band's steadfast belief in their ability to pen a brilliant melody defies all that. The end result is an uplifting, catchy modern rock anthem for the ages.
